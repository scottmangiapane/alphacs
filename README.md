# AlphaCS

AlphaCS is a program manager that is both fast and small compared to similar apps such as MirageOS and DoorsCS. You can now lock, hide, archive and run programs quickly and easily.

## Platform

This program was built for the Texas Instruments 83+/84 graphing calculator (black and white edition). It was made with [Axe Parser](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/456/45659.html), a low-level language syntactically similar to TI-BASIC but compiled into much faster binaries with graphics, grayscale support, multiplayer functionality, and more.
