## AlphaCS

<img src="screenshot.gif" width="192">

AlphaCS is a program manager with a beautiful GUI. This program is both fast and small compared to similar apps such as MirageOS and DoorsCS. You can now lock, hide, archive and run programs quickly and easily. It is password protected and secure to stop people from tampering with your programs. zStart is required to run programs.

## Platform

This program is built for the Texas Instruments 83+/84 graphing calculator (black and white edition).

Note: A NEW VERSION OF zStart IS REQUIRED FOR PARTS OF THIS APP TO WORK, whether or not it is installed. I would recommend zStart version 1.3.013 on a TI-84 Plus. You can download this version of zStart at: http://www.omnimaga.org/ti-z80-calculator-projects/zstart-an-app-that-runs-on-ram-clears/?action=dlattach;attach=16058
